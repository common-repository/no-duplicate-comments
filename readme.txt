**Deprecated** Prevent visitors from leaving duplicate comments/pingbacks/trackbacks to a post.

== Description ==

**Deprecated** Prevent visitors from leaving duplicate comments/pingbacks/trackbacks to a post.

**NOTE: This plugin is no longer necessary as of WordPress 2.0 as the issue has been fixed in WordPress.  Simultaneous to the plugin's release, I submitted the problem the plugin addressed as a bug, in trac [ticket #1262](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1262), which was then fixed in [changeset #2561](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2561)**

== Installation ==

1. This plugin has been deprecated and is no longer supported. It only works for versions of WordPress older than 2.0, none of which should be in use any longer.
